# Pulsar
Pulsar is an uncompleted general purpose toolkit I use for all my spigot plugins. 
Its main objective is to provide highly customizable components for the end-user while 
being simple for the developer to implement.

## Usage
As of right now you will need to clone this repository and either publish it
to maven local or compile and add it as a dependency. There is no repository.
